<msg type="info" file="Route" num="538" delta="new" >One or more MIG cores have been detected in your design and have been successfully
placed and routed. These MIG core(s) have critical skew and delay requirements 
that are independent of the user (UCF) timing constraints. These MIG-related timing 
constraints have been successfully met in this design. However, the user must verify
separately that all timing constraints specified in the UCF file have been met.

</msg>

<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="new" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2761" delta="new" >N/A entries in the Constraints List may indicate that the constraint is not analyzed due to the following: No paths covered by this constraint; Other constraints intersect with this constraint; or This constraint was disabled by a Path Tracing Control. Please run the Timespec Interaction Report (TSI) via command line (trce tsi) or Timing Analyzer GUI.</msg>
